Computer program - set of instructions that a computer can follow to perform some task
Programming language- language to facilitate writing of instructions for computers

C++ Is a high level language, which is compiled to machine code, which the cpu executes.
We use high level langauges as they are:
1. portable
2. easy to understand
3. require fewer instructions

Some langauges like puthon and javascript are interpreted and requires a interpreter.
and Interpeter is a program that directlty executes the instructions into source code wihtout requiring them to be compiled.
Interpreters are more flexible, but slower.
